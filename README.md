# E-Learn_Website
This is an online learning website I created in a week while at University. It was created to work on a local server running on my computer in order to be operational.

The project shows that I know how to do front-end(with HTML and CSS) and back-end development(PHP) and interacting with a Database(SQL) to store and get information.
